## 0x00. Intro

From some point, YubiKeys (https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) have become an essential part of my essential device arsenal. Many services, such as Google, GitHub (web GUI), and others, support them out of the box. Additionally, it is possible to create a certificate on them for SSH authentication. However, this requires some extra effort, as neither Linux nor Windows support this functionality out of the box.

Since certain key configurations can be performed both on Windows and Linux, regardless of the OS where the key will be used later, this article will focus exclusively on the peculiarities of using YubiKey on Linux.
## 0x01. Yubikey

First, you need to configure the YubiKey itself - change the default PIN codes (in case the YubiKey falls into the wrong hands), then create a certificate and export the public key.

How this is done on Windows can be read here: [0x00. Yubikey + ssh/git (Windows)]({{< ref "/posts/00.Yubikey_win.md" >}})

### Yubikey manager (Linux, GUI)

Essentially, it's the same as on Windows, but first, you need to install YubiKey Manager (along with other packages that will be needed later):

```bash
 sudo apt install -y ykcs11 yubico-piv-tool yubikey-manager scdaemon yubikey-personalization opensc libnss3-tools
```

To launch the GUI for YubiKey Manager, execute the command:

```bash
ykman-gui
```

PS: If YubiKey Manager shows the error "Failed connecting to the YubiKey. Make sure the application has the required permissions." (this sometimes happens on recent Ubuntu releases), execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install pcscd
sudo systemctl enable pcscd
sudo systemctl start pcscd
```

If this doesn't help, try the solutions from

[Troubleshooting "Failed connecting to the YubiKey. Make sure the application has the required permissions." in YubiKey Manager](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016648939-Troubleshooting-Failed-connecting-to-the-YubiKey-Make-sure-the-application-has-the-required-permissions-in-YubiKey-Manager)

If you prefer to configure everything via the console (for instance, if your Linux system lacks a graphical interface), then it's the way of the samurai:

```bash
ykman
```

[YubiKey Manager CLI (ykman) User Manual ](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614940-YubiKey-Manager-CLI-ykman-User-Manual)

View connected YubiKey devices:
```bash
ykman list
```

Will output something like:

```bash
└─$ ykman list
YubiKey 5C NFC (5.4.3) [OTP+FIDO+CCID] Serial: 12345678
```


That is, the key model, firmware version, available APIs, and serial number.

Extended information:

```bash
└─$ ykman info  
Device type: YubiKey 5C NFC
Serial number: 12345678
Firmware version: 5.4.3
Form factor: Keychain (USB-C)
Enabled USB interfaces: OTP, FIDO, CCID
NFC transport is enabled

Applications	USB    	NFC    
Yubico OTP  	Enabled	Enabled
FIDO U2F    	Enabled	Enabled
FIDO2       	Enabled	Enabled
OATH        	Enabled	Enabled
PIV         	Enabled	Enabled
OpenPGP     	Enabled	Enabled
YubiHSM Auth	Enabled	Enabled
```

Complete reset of PIV settings/certificates (e.g., if you forgot the PIN/PUK or are reconfiguring from scratch):

```bash
ykman piv reset
```

Changing the PUK:
```bash
ykman piv access change-puk
```

Changing the PIN:

```bash
ykman piv access change-pin
```

Changing the management key (at the same time enabling its protection with a PIN - meaning it will ask for a PIN to confirm each time the management key is used):

```bash
ykman piv keys change-management-key --generate --protect
```

and save the generated key in a secure location, as you'll need it later.

### Certificates

Similarly to how it’s done on Windows.

Or once again, the way of the samurai (here I’m generating it in slot 9c instead of 9a, so it asks for a PIN each time it’s accessed via SSH - paranoia is what it is).

1. First, generate a private key.
2. Create a self-signed certificate.
3. Generate a public key for the created certificate.

All these actions can be performed either using yubico-piv-tool (which we installed at the very beginning) or with the console YubiKey Manager (ykman). In both cases, you’ll need the management key that we created and saved in a secure location earlier. If not—then you’ll have to use ykman exclusively. That’s because yubico-piv-tool, if no management key is specified, uses the default 0102... key, which we prudently replaced with our own. ykman, on the other hand, will simply ask for the PIN code (remember that we protected the management key with a PIN code? This is exactly why—so we don’t have to write it down or store it somewhere else %)).

#### 1. Creating a private key

For example, for a certificate in slot 9c (I’ve already explained why I prefer 9c over 9a), using the 256-bit elliptic curve algorithm:

```bash
ykman piv keys generate --algorithm ECCP256 9c public92.pem
Enter PIN: ******
```

The private key is stored on the YubiKey device, and the public key is saved in public92.pem (default format is PEM).

You can also specify other options:

```bash
└─$ ykman piv keys generate --help                             
Usage: ykman piv keys generate [OPTIONS] SLOT PUBLIC-KEY

  Generate an asymmetric key pair.

  The private key is generated on the YubiKey, and written to one of the slots.

  SLOT        PIV slot of the private key
  PUBLIC-KEY  file containing the generated public key (use '-' to use stdout)

Options:
  -m, --management-key TEXT       the management key
  -P, --pin TEXT                  PIN code
  -a, --algorithm [RSA1024|RSA2048|RSA3072|RSA4096|ECCP256|ECCP384|ED25519|X25519]
                                  algorithm to use in key generation  [default: RSA2048]
  -F, --format [PEM|DER]          encoding format  [default: PEM]
  --pin-policy [DEFAULT|NEVER|ONCE|ALWAYS|MATCH-ONCE|MATCH-ALWAYS]
                                  PIN policy for slot
  --touch-policy [DEFAULT|NEVER|ALWAYS|CACHED]
                                  touch policy for slot
  -h, --help                      show this message and exit
```

#### 2. Creating a certificate using the generated key

Create a certificate in slot 9c being valid for three years, with the subject "x-ssh" (the "CN=" prefix is mandatory!). public92.pem is the public key we saved earlier:

```bash
└─$ ykman piv certificates generate --valid-days=1095 --subject "CN=x-ssh" 9c public92.pem 
Enter PIN: *******
```

Verify:

```bash
└─$ ykman piv info                                                                         
PIV version:              5.4.3
PIN tries remaining:      3/3
PUK tries remaining:      3/3
Management key algorithm: AES256
Management key is stored on the YubiKey, protected by PIN.

## 0x02. OpenSSH

For OpenSSH, we first need to extract the public key in the OpenSSH format.

But first, we need to know the full path to the pkcs11.so library.

Depending on the distribution and package version, it may be located in different places and have different names, for example:

```
/usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so
/usr/lib64/libykcs11.so
```

But there is a common part - *kcs11.so*, so if none of the above-mentioned paths exist on your system, you can try to find it:

```bash
└─$ locate *kcs11.so 
...
/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/lib/libj2pkcs11.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cryptsetup/libcryptsetup-token-systemd-pkcs11.so
...
```

In my case, it is:

```
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so
```

Therefore, execute:

```bash
└─$ ssh-keygen -D /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so -e
...
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBIn6Oc8Bnq+kKEAYCwUILth7Yeo+EqbxP3zXH0UNIT9EIINxhmyNriSF1uu8d3hDIXQvAp4CQr8elNCML85tX54= Public key for Digital Signature
...
```

For slot 9a, the key ends with **Public key for PIV Authentication**, and for 9c, it ends with **Public key for Digital Signature**.

This is the key that we then use on remote systems or GitHub to provide access via YubiKey.

For example, if using SSH, install it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote system by any method, and then from the client machine, execute:

```bash
ssh -I /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so user@host
```
The option
-I /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so
means that if a YubiKey is connected and the corresponding private key exists in slots 9a/9c, it will prompt for a PIN code—and if the PIN is correct, the connection will proceed using the private key. Otherwise, it will fall back to the usual SSH method.

To avoid specifying this option every time, you can set it as the default:

```bash
sudo echo "PKCS11Provider /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libykcs11.so" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/ssh_config
```

In this case, use SSH as usual. This is also very convenient if you're using other programs that rely on SSH, such as git, scp, etc.
